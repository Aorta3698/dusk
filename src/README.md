`Dusk`, created on 04/14/2024, is a well-balanced keyboard layout for columnar keyboard with thumb keys.

The most impressive feat that `Dusk` achieves is that it is remarkably low in (per oxeylyzer, keysolve, cyanophage)
- SFS ` ~4.90%`
- SFB ` ~0.50%`
- 2u SFS `~0.10%`
- Finger speed `~17.33`
- Both full and half scissors and skipgram scissors `0.02%/0.11%/2.09%/4.68%`

while maintaining a reasonable redirection and LSB. As such, `Dusk` is consistent and a good general-purpose thumb layout.
