# Introduction

`Dusk`, created on 04/14/2024, is a well-balanced keyboard layout for columnar keyboard with thumb keys.

The most impressive feat that `Dusk` achieves is that it is remarkably low in
- SFS
- SFB
- 2u SFS
- (Half/Full) scissors

while maintaining a reasonable redirection and LSB. As such, `Dusk` is consistent and a good general-purpose thumb layout.

### Side Note
