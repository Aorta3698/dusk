# Introduction

`Dusk` is a well-balanced keyboard layout for columnar keyboard with thumb keys.

The most impressive feat that `Dusk` achieves is that it is remarkably low in
- SFS
- SFB
- 2u SFS
- Scissors

while maintaining a reasonable redirection and LSB. As such, `Dusk` is consistent and a good general-purpose thumb layout.

### Site Navigation

- Click on the brush icon located on the top left to change sitewide theme.

- On Desktop, there is a table of contents on the right side for each chapter that has more than 1 section.

- Go to the next/previous chapter by clicking on the `>` and `<` icon located on each side of the screen, respectively.


### Fun Fact
- `Dusk` originally was named `Clock` on 04/14/2024 because I did not think it was worth anything.

- `Dusk` had 2 versions: `Dusk` and `Dusk_roll` with vowel thumb `R`, and `Dusk_roll` was removed after having 5 likes on Cmini in favor of `Dusk`, which had no likes at that point.
