# Introduction

`Dusk` is a well-balanced keyboard layout for columnar keyboard with thumb keys.

The most impressive feat that `Dusk` achieves is that it is remarkably low in
- SFS
- SFB
- 2u SFS
- Scissors

while maintaining a reasonable redirection and LSB. As such, `Dusk` is consistent and a good general-purpose thumb layout.


### Fun Fact
- `Dusk` originally was named `Clock` on 04/14/2024 because I did not think it was worth anything.

- `Dusk` had 2 versions: `Dusk` and `Dusk_roll` with vowel thumb `R`, and `Dusk_roll` was removed after having 5 likes on Cmini in favor of `Dusk`, which had no likes at that point.
