# Motivation

As a [Canary-ortho](https://github.com/Apsu/Canary) user for 14 months and reached about 140 wpm on MonkeyType, its flaws - high SFS and high index workload - start to bother me. 

```

```


In particular, I don't vibe with:
- `B_D` and all the `K` interaction with `B__K` (`back`) and `P__K` (`pack`) leading to 2u/2.24u SFS.

- That feeling that left index is flying all over the place at high speed.

- High SFS (compared to modern layouts).

- `LV`, `SYS`, `RL`, `WR`, `CL`.

Don't get me wrong - `Canary-ortho` is a decent layout - but I just hope for something better. I decided to try other modern layouts such as `Graphite`, `Gallium`, `Kuntum`, `Stronk`, and several others, but none of it speaks to me the way that `Canary` does.

Additionally, my keyboard `Piantor Pro` is a split columnar keyboard with an aggressive pinky stagger and 3 thumb keys on each side, and most popular keyboard layouts were designed for conventional rowstag keyboards.

Eventually, after making several different layouts and not finding the one, I realized what I am looking for may not be possible without having a letter on the thumb key. I started to expriment with thumb `Y`, `I`, `S`, and finally landing on thumb `R`: `Dusk`.
