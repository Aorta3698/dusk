# Comparison
Here you can find my thoughts on other thumb layouts and hopefully, a charitable description of them.

Made by `Apsu`, one of the main creators of the beloved `Canary` (2nd most loved layout).

[Aptmak](https://github.com/Apsu/aptmak) has been the go-to option for thumb layout recommendation in AKL discord server. It is the most established thumb layout and has had many users using it full time. It's design goal, as I understand it, is to make a thumb layout based on Colemak and usable for 23332 keyboards.

While its stats on SFS and SFB are not as impressive as Dusk, it's a good choice for people who dislike LSB and don't want to be bothered with relearning to press space with another thumb.

```
Made by the creator of the beloved `Gallium` (3rd most loved layout).

`Bunya` is based on `Gallium` and is currently the best thumb `S` layout that `GalileoBlues` has as of April 2024. 

Stats wise, it's got SFS and SFB that rival Dusk with a higher focus on alternation. It has lower redirection and likely more annoying scissors such as `LV` (`involve`) and `BR` (`break`). From a quick glance, it should have a similar 2u SFS as Dusk.

Some obvious cons are that `RL` SFB is unfortuately a true SFB that can't be alt-fingered and that double thumb `ss` is quite common (`less`, `miss`, `across`, `pass`, `guess`).

Overall, `Bunya` is a very solid thumb layout and likely one of the best thumb `S` layouts to date.

This layout is based on [`Pine-v4`](https://github.com/ClemenPine/PineV4) from ClemenPine. It boasts the highest speed rating and 3rd most comfort rating on the [layout battle website](https://keyboard-layout-battles.fly.dev/layout).

`RST` homerow is familiar to many as it is the same homerow found on Colemak as well, and I personally believe that having `T` on index feels quite good as there are many words that end with `T`, promoting inroll that ends on the strongest finger.

Aside from `BO` scissor (`about`), there really isn't many scissors in this layout, achieved by having 3 dead letters on left hand pinky, ring, and middle fingers. 2u SFS may be a bit higher than Dusk due to `k__g` (`looking`, `thinking`) and `m_g` (`might`) if that's something you care about.

All the while having competitive SFS and SFB stats. Overall, this is the layout that I like the most out of the 3 that we've discussed thus far.

If you want to use `Pine-y`, I would recommend that you do

Made by the creator of `Sturdy`, the 4th most loved layout on AKL discord, and `Oxey` recommends `sturdy_thumbn` for those who seek a thumb layout variant based on `Sturdy`.

By having `N` on thumb, it addresses the `K` scissor-related issues that people have with `Sturdy`. Additionally, it now has one dead key `Q` on the left index, which drastically lowers the finger with the highest finger speed on `Sturdy`.

`Sturdy-thumbn` is an overall improvement on `Sturdy` and with SFS and SFB stats comparable to Dusk as well. I, however, do not like the fact that `ML` (`almost`) and `PO` (`people`, `open`, `stop`, `hope`, `top`) as I found these stretches are not really comfortable on colstag (`Piantor Pro`).

`Oxey` doesn't recommend this over `sturdy-thumbn` and I can see why: it doesn't really address most issues that people have with `Sturdy`. I agree with `Oxey` here.

Made by `Hands Down` creator, a common presence on AKL subreddit.

It is similar to Dusk, and so it makes more sense to compare them.

Pros:
- Much lower LSB than Dusk.
- No corner key like `W` in Dusk.

Subjective:
- More alternation and less roll than Dusk

Cons:
- Similar SFB, but higher SFS.
- `MB` full scissor (`number`).
- Some may be bothered by the `PL` (`simple`) and `LD` (`should`) motions.
- More 2u SFS (`fix`, `public`, `small`).
- More half scissors (`nk`, `m_k` as in `make`).

I wouldn't recommend `SNTH` largely for the same reason that I wouldn't recommend `Dusk_optimized`.

Made by `ddn`, a really helpful person in AKL discord.

`Snth-wuv` is impressive in a way that it has similar SFB but with noticeably lower SFS than Dusk.

Some cons may be:
- `RK` and `GO` scissors as they are quite common (`work` and `go`)
- Heavy ring `RNX` stack.

Made by `val0rance`, a frequenter on AKL discord.

Having 3 dead keys just like Pine-y and sturdy-thumbn ensures that there isn't going to be awkward scissors, but it still has `LK` (`talk`) and `PO` (`top` and `people`) full index-middle stretch on the index.

Overall, it is a decent layout and in many ways reminds me of sturdy-thumbn by Oxey.

```
Made by ClemenPine with a goal to minimize SFS and SFB. It has slightly higher SFB than Dusk, but does achieve lower SFS.

ClemenPine themselves does not seem to recommend this layout. I agree with them here because of the common `PI` scissor (`piece` and `stupid`) and `SY` on ring is probably suboptimal (`system`).

```
Made by the creator of `Gallium` (2nd most loved layout on AKL discord).

This layout is solid all around, but `LHM` ring certainly isn't for everyone due to its high movement and 2u SFS, in addition to the `LK` scissor (`talk`).

```
Made by `yappi`, a frequenter on AKL discord.

This layout has similar SFS and SFB as Dusk, and it doesn't have the `W` index corner key nor the LSB that Dusk has.

What's the catch? The catch to achieve all that is the heavy and high movement `LHM` ring, in addition to the `LK` and `SM` scissors (`talk` and `small`).

Is the trade worth it? for me it is not worth it, but maybe it is for you!

```
Made by `val0rance`, a frequenter on AKL discord.

Some people like having `T` on index, and `Snert` doesn't have the high index movement that some other index `T` layouts have. 

I think we should swap `BP` to address `bl` (`able`) and `mp` (`important`) though, but then `SP` scissor gets created (`space`).
