## Dusk
- On my keyboard Piantor, `R` is slightly to the right of what's shown here.
- This variant with `,.` and `r<spc>` swaps is what I personally use.
- To read my 6 weeks experience, read [here](../journeys/2024_Jun_5.md).

## Dusk-vq
It's made to address concern over `V`.

This variant has similar stats but with even lower scissor at the expense of having left index do more work and higher 2u SFS from `g_v`.

- The higher 2u SFS can further be addressed by swapping `PG`, but `NG` and `G_T` become slightly worse.

- Or you can swap `WV`, but make sure you are okay with typing `know`.

## Variants in Cmini bots
For the curious: In `Cmini` discord bots, you can find dusk variants created by me and other people with `!cmini filter --name dusk`.
