# Terminology

- **Same Finger Bigram (SFB)**: Pressing two keys with the same finger in conjunction.

- **Same Finger Skipgram (SFS)**: Pressing two keys with the same finger, but separated by x letters (1 keypress).

- **Disjointed Same Finger Bigram (dSFB)**: Synonym for SFS. Not used as much anymore.

- **Lateral Stretch Bigram (LSB)**: A bigram where your hand must stretch laterally, as in using the middle finger following middle column usage on the same hand. An example is `be` on QWERTY.

- **Alt-fingering**: Pressing a key with a different finger than would be typed with traditional touch typing technique.

- **Alternation**: Pressing a key with the opposite hand than you typed the last.

- **Roll**: Typing two or more keys with the same hand, moving in the same "direction". For example, on QWERTY, `sdf` would be a roll, but `sfd` would not.

- **Inward/Outward Roll**: A roll which goes in a particular direction. Inward means towards the center of the keyboard, like `df` on QWERTY. Outward means away from the center, like `fd` on QWERTY. Many people, but not all, consider inward rolls to be more comfortable than outward rolls.

- **Redirect/Redirection**: A one-handed sequence of at least three letters that 'changes directions'. For example, on QWERTY, `sfd` would be a redirect, but `sdf` would not.

- **Hand Balance**: How much work each hand does for a layout. For example, a 35%:65% hand balance would mean that the left hand types 35% of keys, and the right hand types 65%.

- **Scissor**: A vague concept that generally refers to fingers curling or extending in awkward relations to other fingers on the same hand. QWERTY `cw` and `ex` are usually considered significant examples of scissors.

- **Half-Scissor Bigram (HSB)**: A half-scissor is a pattern where one finger needs to stretch or contract to press a key on the top or bottom row and another finger on the same hand stays on the homerow - but the finger that is on the lower of the two rows is either middle or ring. `ok`, `sc`, and `rd` are common examples of half-scissors on QWERTY.

- **Full-Scissor Bigram (FSB)**: A full-scissor is a pattern where one finger needs to reach to the top row and another finger on the same hand needs to contract to hit the bottom row - but the finger that is on the lower of two rows is either middle or ring. `cr`, `ex`, `xt` are all FSBs on QWERTY.

- **Half-Scissor Skipgram (HSS)**: Similar to `HSB` except it is separated by 1 keypress from another finger.

- **Full-Scissor Skipgram (FSS)**: Similar to `FSB` except it is separated by 1 keypress from another finger.

- **Lateral Stretch Skipgram (LSS)**: Similar to `LSB` except it is separated by 1 keypress from another finger.

- **Onehand (ONE)**: A onehand is when all three keypresses are pressed on the same hand, and in an order from left to right or right to left. `asd`, `sdf`, and `fds` are all onehands on QWERTY.
